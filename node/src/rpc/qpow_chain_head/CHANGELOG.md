# Changelog - QPoW ChainHead RPC

All notable changes to the QPoW ChainHead RPC implementation will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.0] - 2024-01-XX

### Added
- Initial implementation of QPoW-aware chainHead RPC methods
- Custom subscription management that handles large finality gaps (up to 200 blocks)
- Event streaming for blockchain updates (Initialized, NewBlock, BestBlockChanged, Finalized, Stop)
- Block header retrieval functionality
- Comprehensive unit tests for subscription management
- Full documentation including README.md and inline documentation
- Module-level documentation explaining implementation status

### Fixed
- Import issues:
  - Removed unused `CallError` import
  - Changed `SubscriptionSink` to `PendingSubscriptionSink` for proper trait implementation
  - Added `use sp_api::Core` for runtime version access
  - Added `use sp_runtime::Saturating` for numeric operations
  - Fixed `tokio` references to use `jsonrpsee::tokio`
- Type issues:
  - Added proper type annotations for `FollowEvent` generic parameters
  - Fixed `SubscriptionMessage` construction using `from_json`
  - Replaced custom `StringError` with jsonrpsee's built-in `StringError`
  - Added trait bounds `NumberFor<Block>: From<u32>` for numeric comparisons
- Field name issues:
  - Fixed `state_version` â†’ `system_version` in RuntimeVersion mapping
- Subscription handling:
  - Fixed event serialization for all event types
  - Proper error handling for subscription lifecycle

### Changed
- Improved error messages to be more descriptive
- Enhanced logging to better track finality gaps
- Simplified test imports to avoid unnecessary dependencies
- Better separation of concerns between modules

### Cleaned
- Removed all unnecessary `mut` modifiers from variables
- Eliminated unused imports across all modules
- Fixed all clippy warnings
- Added proper handling for TODO placeholders with explicit variable usage
- Improved code documentation with detailed explanations

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive module-level documentation
- Documented all public types and functions
- Added implementation status indicators (âœ…/ðŸš§) for each RPC method
- Created detailed README.md with architecture overview and usage guide
- Enhanced inline comments explaining complex logic

### Technical Details
- **Compilation**: All errors resolved, builds successfully in Ubuntu container
- **Warnings**: All compiler warnings addressed
- **Code Quality**: Passes clippy checks with standard settings
- **Test Coverage**: Unit tests for core subscription management functionality
- **Documentation Coverage**: 100% of public APIs documented

### Known Limitations
- Body retrieval not yet implemented (returns placeholder operation ID)
- Runtime API calls not yet implemented (returns placeholder operation ID)
- Storage queries not yet implemented (returns placeholder operation ID)
- Operation continuation/cancellation not yet implemented

### Migration Notes
- Frontend applications should use `qpowChainHead_v1_*` methods instead of `chainHead_v1_*`
- No changes required to event handling - same format as standard chainHead
- Subscription IDs now use "qpow-" prefix for easy identification
