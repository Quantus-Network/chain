# Merkle Airdrop Pallet

A Substrate pallet for distributing tokens via Merkle proofs.

## Testing & Usage

For testing and interacting with this pallet, please refer to the CLI tool and example  PR in the [resonance-api-client](https://github.com/Resonance-Network/resonance-api-client/pull/5) repository:
- `examples/ac-examples-async/examples/merkle_airdrop_cli.rs`
- `examples/ac-examples-async/examples/merkle_airdrop_cli-README.md` for the documentation

These tool demonstrates how to:
- Generate Merkle trees and proofs
- Create and fund airdrops
- Claim tokens using proofs
